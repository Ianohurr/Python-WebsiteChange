# Python-WebsiteChange
Checking to see when the HTML for a site changes to a certain thing

Alert me if a website changes in a certain way

So I'm going to start practicing with web scraping and conveniently the new Spider-Man movie is coming out. I want to go see this movie at a theater called "Roadhouse" because they are amazing. They only tell you the day they start selling tickets, not the time. There's about 63 seats in a movie theater so I'm going to set up a bot that will alert me when a certain part of the HTML changes showing me that the tickets are on sale. Currently the code is just me messing with web scraping because the page for the tickets doesn't open until 6/29/2017 I believe
